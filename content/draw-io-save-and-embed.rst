**Note**: Draft Article

Background
----------

`draw.io <https://www.draw.io/>`_ is a web-based diagramming application which integrates with GitHub, Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox and more. It is built by `jGraph <https://www.jgraph.com/>`_ and based on their mxGraph library which became an `open-source project <https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph>`_ in 2016.

One of the most attractive features (for me, at least) is the ability to save to GitHub using commits and then embed that content in HTML. Here is an example, with a how-to to follow.

Example
*******

.. raw:: html

   <iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:800px;" src="https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=GitHub-workflows.xml#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjoshmorel%2FGitHub-tips%2Fmaster%2Ffigures%2FGitHub-workflows.xml"></iframe>

Create and Save to GitHub
