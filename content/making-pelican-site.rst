Background
----------

Pelican is a static site generated written in Python. I've previously used jekyll which is ruby based, but Python is a more comfortable world for me thus the switch.

This outlines how I started this site with Pelican, with input from a variety of other posts as well as the comprehensive `docs <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_
